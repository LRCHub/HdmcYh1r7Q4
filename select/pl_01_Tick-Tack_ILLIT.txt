저 멀리 네가 보여
내 맘은 비상사태
So hurry 얼른 열어
나의 맘속의 cabinet
어떡해 tick tack ti-tack
시끄러운 옷장 속
너는 어떤 날 좋아할까
It's my fitting room
바꿔 attitude
어떤 version의
날 좋아할까
무채색의 look
괜히 펼친 book
못 본척해 my heart

Oh, oh my god
또 나를 보고 있잖아
제일 쿨한 mode click! click!
어떤데 나
너랑 어울리잖아
너는 어떤 날 좋아할까
유치한 건 꾹
옷장 속에 푹
구겨 넣으면
날 좋아할까
고민 고민 휴
Tick tack ti-tack 쿵
시끄러워 My heart

Umm
알아가면 갈수록
좋아하면 할수록
새로운 날 만나서
Oh 놀랄 거야
Umm
기대해도 될 거야
이제 시작일 뿐이야
새로운 날 만나줘
Oh nice to see ya
